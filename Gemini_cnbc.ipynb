      "\n",
      "💭 REASONING:\n",
      "   • Sentimen: Sentimen keseluruhan untuk saham BBCA hari ini cenderung negatif. Dari 25 berita yang dianalisis, 52% bersifat negatif dan hanya 40% yang positif, menghasilkan rata-rata sentiment score yang negatif (-0.16/10). Meskipun ada satu berita positif mengenai masuknya dana asing, dampaknya tereduksi oleh dominasi berita negatif yang lebih baru dan relevan.\n",
      "   • Momentum: Momentum pasar untuk BBCA saat ini terlihat bearish. Dua berita terbaru secara eksplisit menyebutkan BBCA sebagai 'pemberat utama' bagi IHSG yang ditutup melemah. Hal ini menunjukkan tekanan jual yang kuat dan kinerja BBCA yang di bawah rata-rata pasar, bahkan saat IHSG sempat menunjukkan penguatan di sesi sebelumnya.\n",
      "   • Risk: Tingkat risiko untuk berinvestasi di BBCA saat ini tergolong tinggi. Risiko meliputi pelemahan IHSG, tekanan pada sektor keuangan, risiko makroekonomi Indonesia (defisit fiskal, tekanan eksternal), serta risiko reputasi terkait pencekalan bos Grup Djarum sebagai pemilik mayoritas. Potensi reward jangka pendek terlihat tidak seimbang dengan risiko yang ada.\n",
      "   • Catalyst: Katalis negatif lebih dominan dan baru-baru ini terjadi. Katalis seperti pelemahan IHSG dengan BBCA sebagai pemberat, serta berita pencekalan bos Grup Djarum, menciptakan sentimen negatif yang kuat. Meskipun ada katalis positif dari aliran modal asing, pengaruhnya sepertinya tidak cukup untuk melawan tekanan jual yang ada.\n",
      "\n",
      "📋 ACTION PLAN:\n",
      "   • Jika Beli: Tunggu konfirmasi pembalikan sentimen pasar yang jelas dan sinyal teknikal bullish, idealnya ketika BBCA menunjukkan penguatan konsisten di atas level resistance terdekat atau saat sentimen makro membaik secara signifikan.\n",
      "   • Target Price: Tidak dapat ditentukan secara presisi mengingat kondisi pasar yang tidak stabil dan sentimen negatif yang dominan. Target harga akan dievaluasi setelah adanya pembalikan tren dan sentimen positif yang berkelanjutan.\n",
      "   • Stop Loss: Bagi investor yang sudah memiliki posisi, disarankan untuk meninjau ulang level stop loss untuk melindungi modal dari potensi penurunan lebih lanjut. Bagi yang belum masuk, hindari menentukan stop loss saat ini karena tidak ada posisi beli yang direkomendasikan.\n",
      "   • Holding Period: Tidak direkomendasikan untuk masuk dengan periode holding pendek (trading) dalam kondisi saat ini. Untuk investasi jangka panjang, disarankan untuk tetap memantau perkembangan makroekonomi dan reputasi Grup Djarum, meskipun fundamental BBCA umumnya solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔑 KEY POINTS:\n",
      "   ✓ Sentimen keseluruhan sangat negatif dengan 52% berita negatif dan rata-rata skor sentimen -0.16/10.\n",
      "   ✓ BBCA menjadi pemberat utama IHSG dalam sesi perdagangan terakhir yang melemah, menunjukkan tekanan jual yang signifikan.\n",
      "   ✓ Risiko reputasi dari pemilik mayoritas (Grup Djarum) terkait kasus korupsi pajak menciptakan sentimen negatif tambahan.\n",
      "   ✓ Meskipun ada aliran dana asing yang positif, dampaknya saat ini tereduksi oleh sentimen negatif lainnya yang lebih dominan.\n",
      "   ✓ Kondisi makroekonomi Indonesia dan tekanan pada sektor keuangan menambah ketidakpastian.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚠️  WARNINGS:\n",
      "   ! Potensi tekanan jual yang kuat dapat berlanjut dalam jangka pendek, mendorong harga lebih rendah.\n",
      "   ! Kabar terkait Grup Djarum dapat menimbulkan volatilitas tambahan dan kekhawatiran reputasi.\n",
      "   ! Hindari upaya 'catching a falling knife' (membeli saat harga terus turun) tanpa konfirmasi pembalikan tren yang jelas.\n",
      "   ! Perlambatan sektor keuangan dan kondisi makro yang menantang dapat mempengaruhi kinerja fundamental BBCA ke depan.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 KESIMPULAN:\n",
      "   Berdasarkan analisis sentimen berita hari ini, kondisi pasar untuk saham BBCA cenderung negatif dengan tekanan jual yang kuat dan risiko yang meningkat. Investor disarankan untuk TUNGGU DULU pembelian saham BBCA saat ini hingga ada katalis positif yang jelas dan stabilisasi harga.\n",
